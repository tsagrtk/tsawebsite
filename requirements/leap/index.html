      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
       Up to this point our Website design group have practiced three of the main five factors of The Student Leadership Challenge. To start, our group thrived on relying on each other for help and support. I feel we practiced two main part model the way and encourage the heart. Why? Model the way is when you show how just help tell how, so when each of our team members needed help we always showed each other what should be done. For example, if a team member forgot a tag in html, we would show them how to write it and how it can be used. Next, was encourage the heart, our team supports each other and a main factor of that is we built trust and passion together as a team. Finally, we practiced inspire a shared vision. Many groups get into many conflicts, but our conflicts stayed at the minimum. That is because we practiced inspiring a shared vision. We would hear out everyone's ideas and inspire a better product out of it.

I think the members of our teams got to experience Leadership Roles in our team. They were able to lead their sections and parts. We can all say that we were all leaders in our group. The reason that we were all able to be leaders were that we were all responsible for our part.
